Wild Meadows Floral Company Site


This was a Challenge Project set by Codecademy. I used Flexbox and responsive design (along with HTML and CSS)to complete the page, and I was also
required to include these things:

 +A title and logo or splash image.
 +A mission statement or brief description of the company.
 +A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.

The design choices were entirely up to me. 

This was the first time I used Flexbox and responsive design without any design specs or guidance, and it helped solidify my 
Flexbox skills.
